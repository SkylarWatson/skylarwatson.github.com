Imagine being able to forecast an outage before it occurs. How would that impact your business? Many organizations don't realize a problem until it's too late. In fact, during an ITIC survey, it was found that "98% of organizations say a single hour of downtime costs $100,000; 81% of respondents indicated that 60 minutes of downtime costs their business over $300,000. And a record one-third or 33% of enterprises report that one hour of downtime costs their firms $1 million to over $5 million.".
